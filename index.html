                <p class="callout">Hi, my name is Tara Bergener. I live in Southern Florida and I enjoy playing volleyball with my husband. 
                We have been blessed with three beautiful children and hope to grow our family in the future. 
                My husband recently separated from the military back in December of 2023. This has been a huge transition for our family, especially our children.
                With his separation, we are new residents to Florida, having moved from Oceanside California, where they have the military base, Camp Pendleton.
                We loved playing volleyball on the beach, hanging out with our friends, and taking advantage of all the fun activities they had set up for the kids.
                Even though we miss our Oceanside, we are happy to be in Florida closer to family and chasing our dreams.
                My husband and I are both in school, which can certianly make for some crazy days with three kids, but we are rolling with the punches and making the most of each and every day.

                    <p>Florida population has seen a steady 1.1 to 1.9% growth over the past 3 years. Our prohets and apostles have been inspired by the Lord to build new temples in Florida over the passed few years, bringing the state to 5 temples in total; to include the Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tallahassee, and Tampa Florida Temples.</p>
